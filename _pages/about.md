Hi, I’m Debabrot Bhuyan — a Data Science Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that drive real-world impact. With 8 years of experience across data science, MLOps, and cloud engineering, I specialize in developing end-to-end machine learning solutions that scale efficiently in production.

I’m currently leading a project to build an AI-powered chatbot using AWS Lex and Amazon Bedrock, combining conversational design with the power of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging tools like AWS CDK, Boto3, and Lambda, I'm crafting a fully automated, serverless architecture — while applying DevOps best practices using CodeCommit and CI/CD workflows.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked on recommender systems, telemetry platforms, and NLP pipelines that have significantly improved performance, cost-efficiency, and user experience for global clients. I love translating technical complexity into clean, modular, and impactful solutions — and sharing what I learn along the way.

This blog is where I explore the intersection of AI, cloud, and engineering — with practical tutorials, insights, and lessons from the field.
